# MyAlgorithms

This serves as an online repistory to some of my past code from various websites as well as personal pratice.
Most of these are either solutions to problems from online sources such as HackerRank or personal challenges or
tasks that I've done in my spare time. Most if not all are small and are not to be used in any manner outside of
code review.

Keep in mind for a sample of completed, large and functional projects such as EraserBot or CSS Organizer,
please refer to my other repristories.
