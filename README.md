# My-Algorithms

This repository servers as an online codebase for any spare or random code I've written and uploaded during my spare time, they contain practice scripts, solutions to online challenges such as HackerRank or CodeGolf. Please note that the files in this repository are small and are not to be used in any professional manner, rather they are a relection of my coding style. 

Keep in mind for my large, functional, and complete projects such as Eraser-Bot or CSS-Organizer,
